        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Anaïs Gonzalvez, a 18-year-old student currently embarking on my academic journey at ESSEC in Singapore. Born on October 19, 2005, in the picturesque country of France, I bring with me a passion for learning and a dedication to excellence. As I delve into the world of business studies at ESSEC, I am eager to explore the dynamic intersection of theory and practice that defines the field. Studying in Singapore offers me not only a diverse and vibrant cultural experience but also access to one of the world's leading business hubs. Every lecture, assignment, and interaction is an opportunity for growth and discovery, and I am committed to making the most of my time here at ESSEC. Through hard work, curiosity, and a spirit of innovation, I aim to cultivate the skills and knowledge necessary to thrive in the ever-evolving landscape of global business. This first homework assignment on the Wagon marks the beginning of what I hope will be a rewarding and transformative educational journey.</p>
